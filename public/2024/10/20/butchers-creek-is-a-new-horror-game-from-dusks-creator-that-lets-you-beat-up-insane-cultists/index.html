        <p>Valve recently held the seasonal Steam Next Fest, an event where you can try hundreds of demos of games still in development releasing soon on Steam. Honestly, the Steam Next Fest has too many games to play, but one that I absolutely wanted to try was <strong>Butcher's Creek</strong>. It's the latest project from David Szymanski, known for the popular boomer shooter Dusk and for the great underwater horror title Iron Lung, so this is why I had to play the demo as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Butcher's Creek is a first-person horror game that tells the story of a pretty insane man in search of some gory video material in the remote Appalachian Forest. After hearing rumours of authentic snuff videotapes, this troubled loner is led to an abandoned cabin near Butcher's Creek, Pennsylvania, where he gets kidnapped by a group of sadistic killers. Our mission is to flee from a mysterious prison and from these cultists while searching for those videotapes for our own pleasure (the protagonist's pleasure, at least).</p>

<p>As Szymanski himself explains on the game's Steam page, Butcher's Creek is inspired by classics like Rockstar Games' controversial Manhunt and Condemned: Criminals Origins, a game made by Monolith, the studio that created F.E.A.R., one of my favourite FPSs ever. The inspiration from Condemned: Criminal Origins is clear almost immediately, as the gameplay revolves around a melee combat system that forces the player to use various items, such as wooden planks, shovels, hammers and box cutters to put the cultists to sleep. You can't use weapons such as guns and shotguns, but you need to go face-to-face with the killers to let them know that their plan to chop you into little pieces to foster their peculiar sadism isn't going to work for you.</p>
<p>Every weapon in Butcher's Creek can only be used a few times, but fortunately, there will always be something near you that you can use to fight the cultists. Don't worry, you're not going to end up empty-handed. Also, weapons have their own stats: some items do more damage than others, but they can take their own sweet little time to hit the enemies. If you decide to use a shovel and you're still waiting to be able to hit a cultist after delivering the first attack, you should know that you can use your feet to push them away a bit. The combat system also lets you parry incoming attacks, and you can throw boxes and other stuff if you have nothing in your hands.</p>

<p>Stamina is a thing in Butcher's Creek, and the only way to replenish it is to wait a few seconds. This means that you can't spam attacks or kicks, so you should pay attention to the stamina bar: being in a fight with one or even two cultists without stamina could turn you into one of their victims. These insane cultists, however, are pretty easy to take down, even though their AI is not the best. A lot of times I noticed them attack me, then step back and stand still as if they had forgotten they were in the middle of a fight. I basically never had to parry an attack: hit the enemy, step back and hit them again is a strategy that worked pretty well.</p>
<p>Moving past the combat system, I really liked how video tapes and photographs are used in Butcher's Creek. Video tapes can be used to save the game and to open some locked, big doors, while with the gory photographs you can heal yourself. And by the way, after obtaining a certain number of video tapes your maximum health will increase. I have some questions on how can images full of gore and blood be used to increase your health, but since our protagonist is a troubled and (probably) insane person, I won't say anything more, except that he should probably seek help.</p>

<p>What I appreciated so much about Butcher's Creek is the ambience, filled with tension. Finding yourself in a dark place kidnapped by some cultists who plan to kill you is obviously scary, and the game does transmit this sense of dread pretty well. Indeed, I admit that I was scared myself sometimes: you know, turning a corner and being suddenly faced by a man shouting, &quot;Who are you?&quot;, with a hammer in their hand is not exactly something I look forward to.</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on Butcher's Creek, waiting for the complete game that should launch early next year. If you're bored, have half an hour where you don't know what to do and the idea of being locked up in a bunker somewhere in Pennsylvania doesn't frighten you, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" >try the demo on Steam</a>. It's worth it.</p>
