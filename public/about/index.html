<title>About | Alessandro Zangrandi</title>
<link rel="canonical" href="https://alexzan.me/about/">
<meta name="description" content="Hi there, I&#39;m Alessandro Zangrandi, a 19 year old from Italy known on the Internet as Alexzan. In my life I develop stuff, I&#39;m a student (just finished high school, but I&#39;m planning to go to university), a &quot;writer&quot; and a videogames and anime and manga enthusiast.
I love computers and technology in general since I was small, and I started playing games when I was in elementary school. When I entered middle school I was incredibly interested in old tech stuff (I still am, to be honest), installing probably a dozen of Windows and Linux VMs just to try them out and using game emulators." />

        <p>Hi there, I'm Alessandro Zangrandi, a 19 year old from Italy known on the Internet as Alexzan. In my life I develop stuff, I'm a student (just finished high school, but I'm planning to go to university), a &quot;writer&quot; and a videogames and anime and manga enthusiast.</p>
<p>I love computers and technology in general since I was small, and I started playing games when I was in elementary school. When I entered middle school I was incredibly interested in old tech stuff (I still am, to be honest), installing probably a dozen of Windows and Linux VMs just to try them out and using game emulators. In that period I learned how to use a Linux-based system, and currently I manage a server for all of my stuff. I experimented with various programming languages and game engines, but I never focused on something in particular.</p>
<p>After entering high school I learned the basics of Python and JavaScript, but also WordPress (the CMS of my videogames blog) and PHP (HTML and CSS included). While I made small projects, I never had the opportunity to work on anything big, and this is something I want to do in the future because I love learning new things.</p>
<p>You can find all of my projects in its <a href="/projects" >dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of other things, I'm confident in my English (while I never took any official exam). I want to learn seriously Japanese, but I'm still at the beginning. I really like writing, and this is one of the reasons why I started this blog: to talk about anything I want in an extensive way. You can expect serious stuff and random posts at the same time. Sometimes I just want to have fun writing.</p>
<p>Regarding anime and manga, I'm a big fan of romance and slice of life works, but I also like other genres (I don't like battle shounen, though). Obviously I play videogames, mainly FPSs. Metroid is probably my favorite franchise (thank you, Nintendo), but I'm not too fond of metroidvanias. Sometimes I watch movies and TV series and I listen to music (check out my cringey <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Alexzan_" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" >Last.fm account</a>).</p>
<p>I know that I'm young, and this is probably why I want to do a lot of things and have dreams that I'd like to make a reality. It's time to get to work.</p>
