      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s be honest: everyone talks about paranormal occurrences every now and then. Be it because of some movie you&#39;ve seen or a game you&#39;ve played, or because you heard something odd while you were peacefully sleeping at 3 AM (spoiler: it probably was your cat), we, as humans, are interested in this kind of stuff. But while we just ignore a lot of these events or laugh at them, there&#39;s a group of pretty bizarre people who decide instead to dive into these mysteries: the Urban Myth Dissolution Center. And this is what &lt;strong&gt;Urban Myth Dissolution Center&lt;/strong&gt;, a detective game developed by the Japanese indie studio Hakaba Bunko and published by Shueisha Games &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269890/Urban_Myth_Dissolution_Center_Demo/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;whose demo was available during the last Steam Next Fest&lt;/a&gt;, is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game tells the story of Azami Fukurai, a CS University student (hey, she&#39;s like me, poor soul) in her third year who, one day, while walking, notices an advertisement of this Urban Myth Dissolution Center. Azami can see ghosts and other entities that normal people don&#39;t even know about. Desperate, Azami decides to pay a visit to this private entity to try to find a solution for this problem that just won&#39;t leave her alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After entering the Center, Azami gets to know the director, Ayumu Meguriya: he knows everything about her, despite having never seen her before, thanks to an ability known as clairvoyance. Ayumu also knows about Azami&#39;s problem, that, after breaking a cursed chair, is basically forced to work part-time for the Center as a way to repay her debt. Alongside her colleague Jasmine, who at first doesn&#39;t seem to be particularly interested in giving Azami a hand, and the director&#39;s help, our protagonist has to investigate some paranormal events related to urban legends that she will have to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While investigating, Azami has to find some clues exploring the place she is in and talking to who is involved in these events. When needed, Azami uses a particular pair of glasses that the director gave her to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; thoughts and memories of places and people that show up as shadows and ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These glasses are also going to be useful during another part of the investigation, which is researching social media. With the help of Jasmine, Azami will read posts on a website that reminds me a lot of Twitter (there are mean comments, that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s Twitter) to get a clearer picture of the situation she has to investigate. Some posts have wobbly keywords that, when read with the glasses, give you a clue useful to the case. I&#39;m not too fond of this mechanics because of the number of posts that have to be analyzed, but I appreciated a lot how the development team created for every post a unique conversation between Azami and Jasmine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once found, some clues are simply jotted down by Azami and saved in a menu that you can open up at any time to get a recap of the investigation, but others will require you to make a little effort. Sometimes you&#39;ll have to complete a mini puzzle where the goal is to fill spaces in a sentence with various terms. This is pretty interesting, even though I found it to be too simple. There are no penalties if you get something wrong, and it&#39;s easy to understand the correct phrase due to the grammar and conjunctions. In the case you don&#39;t get the sentence right, the game will still highlight the words put in the right place so that you don&#39;t have to start from scratch. Neat idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t that much satisfied with the difficulty of the demo. Sure, I didn&#39;t certainly expect to solve a complex case at the beginning of the game, but I would have liked more obstacles. The prologue&#39;s case and the real, first investigation act as tutorials, so I get that the developers wanted to make them easy. However, I am hopeful that the next cases will be increasingly harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban Myth Dissolution Center mixes the more classic point-and-click games with visual novels: while investigating, you have to select the people and items that you want to interact with, while the story is told with a dialogue system you&#39;ve probably seen a lot in Japanese games. What also caught my interest was the art style, as Urban Myth Dissolution Center is a pixel art game with a cool color palette leaning toward blue and light blue colors that highlight elements useful in investigations with a bright red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit it, I was pretty impressed by the Urban Myth Dissolution Center demo. I think it&#39;s a detective game with great potential, and my feedback is absolutely positive. I hope that the full game, releasing next February on PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, offers a really compelling story. I would like to help the unfortunate Azami to pay off her debt and make her return to her everyday life, leaving the world of the paranormal behind, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Valve recently held the seasonal Steam Next Fest, an event where you can try hundreds of demos of games still in development releasing soon on Steam. Honestly, the Steam Next Fest has too many games to play, but one that I absolutely wanted to try was &lt;strong&gt;Butcher&#39;s Creek&lt;/strong&gt;. It&#39;s the latest project from David Szymanski, known for the popular boomer shooter Dusk and for the great underwater horror title Iron Lung, so this is why I had to play the demo as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butcher&#39;s Creek is a first-person horror game that tells the story of a pretty insane man in search of some gory video material in the remote Appalachian Forest. After hearing rumours of authentic snuff videotapes, this troubled loner is led to an abandoned cabin near Butcher&#39;s Creek, Pennsylvania, where he gets kidnapped by a group of sadistic killers. Our mission is to flee from a mysterious prison and from these cultists while searching for those videotapes for our own pleasure (the protagonist&#39;s pleasure, at least).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexzan.me/images/posts/2024/10/Butchers-Creek-20241020010245_1.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A screenshot from Butcher&amp;#39;s Creek.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Szymanski himself explains on the game&#39;s Steam page, Butcher&#39;s Creek is inspired by classics like Rockstar Games&#39; controversial Manhunt and Condemned: Criminals Origins, a game made by Monolith, the studio that created F.E.A.R., one of my favourite FPSs ever. The inspiration from Condemned: Criminal Origins is clear almost immediately, as the gameplay revolves around a melee combat system that forces the player to use various items, such as wooden planks, shovels, hammers and box cutters to put the cultists to sleep. You can&#39;t use weapons such as guns and shotguns, but you need to go face-to-face with the killers to let them know that their plan to chop you into little pieces to foster their peculiar sadism isn&#39;t going to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every weapon in Butcher&#39;s Creek can only be used a few times, but fortunately, there will always be something near you that you can use to fight the cultists. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not going to end up empty-handed. Also, weapons have their own stats: some items do more damage than others, but they can take their own sweet little time to hit the enemies. If you decide to use a shovel and you&#39;re still waiting to be able to hit a cultist after delivering the first attack, you should know that you can use your feet to push them away a bit. The combat system also lets you parry incoming attacks, and you can throw boxes and other stuff if you have nothing in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexzan.me/images/posts/2024/10/Butchers-Creek-20241020011500_1.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A screenshot from Butcher&amp;#39;s Creek.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamina is a thing in Butcher&#39;s Creek, and the only way to replenish it is to wait a few seconds. This means that you can&#39;t spam attacks or kicks, so you should pay attention to the stamina bar: being in a fight with one or even two cultists without stamina could turn you into one of their victims. These insane cultists, however, are pretty easy to take down, even though their AI is not the best. A lot of times I noticed them attack me, then step back and stand still as if they had forgotten they were in the middle of a fight. I basically never had to parry an attack: hit the enemy, step back and hit them again is a strategy that worked pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving past the combat system, I really liked how video tapes and photographs are used in Butcher&#39;s Creek. Video tapes can be used to save the game and to open some locked, big doors, while with the gory photographs you can heal yourself. And by the way, after obtaining a certain number of video tapes your maximum health will increase. I have some questions on how can images full of gore and blood be used to increase your health, but since our protagonist is a troubled and (probably) insane person, I won&#39;t say anything more, except that he should probably seek help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexzan.me/images/posts/2024/10/Butchers-Creek-20241020011702_1.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;A screenshot from Butcher&amp;#39;s Creek.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I appreciated so much about Butcher&#39;s Creek is the ambience, filled with tension. Finding yourself in a dark place kidnapped by some cultists who plan to kill you is obviously scary, and the game does transmit this sense of dread pretty well. Indeed, I admit that I was scared myself sometimes: you know, turning a corner and being suddenly faced by a man shouting, &amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot;, with a hammer in their hand is not exactly something I look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep an eye on Butcher&#39;s Creek, waiting for the complete game that should launch early next year. If you&#39;re bored, have half an hour where you don&#39;t know what to do and the idea of being locked up in a bunker somewhere in Pennsylvania doesn&#39;t frighten you, &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;try the demo on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
