Let's be honest: everyone talks about paranormal occurrences every now and then. Be it because of some movie you've seen or a game you've played, or because you heard something odd while you were peacefully sleeping at 3 AM (spoiler: it probably was your cat), we, as humans, are interested in this kind of stuff. But while we just ignore a lot of these events or laugh at them, there's a group of pretty bizarre people who decide instead to dive into these mysteries: the Urban Myth Dissolution Center. And this is what **Urban Myth Dissolution Center**, a detective game developed by the Japanese indie studio Hakaba Bunko and published by Shueisha Games [whose demo was available during the last Steam Next Fest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269890/Urban_Myth_Dissolution_Center_Demo/), is about.

The game tells the story of Azami Fukurai, a CS University student (hey, she's like me, poor soul) in her third year who, one day, while walking, notices an advertisement of this Urban Myth Dissolution Center. Azami can see ghosts and other entities that normal people don't even know about. Desperate, Azami decides to pay a visit to this private entity to try to find a solution for this problem that just won't leave her alone.

After entering the Center, Azami gets to know the director, Ayumu Meguriya: he knows everything about her, despite having never seen her before, thanks to an ability known as clairvoyance. Ayumu also knows about Azami's problem, that, after breaking a cursed chair, is basically forced to work part-time for the Center as a way to repay her debt. Alongside her colleague Jasmine, who at first doesn't seem to be particularly interested in giving Azami a hand, and the director's help, our protagonist has to investigate some paranormal events related to urban legends that she will have to explain.

While investigating, Azami has to find some clues exploring the place she is in and talking to who is involved in these events. When needed, Azami uses a particular pair of glasses that the director gave her to "see" thoughts and memories of places and people that show up as shadows and ghosts.

These glasses are also going to be useful during another part of the investigation, which is researching social media. With the help of Jasmine, Azami will read posts on a website that reminds me a lot of Twitter (there are mean comments, that's why I think it's Twitter) to get a clearer picture of the situation she has to investigate. Some posts have wobbly keywords that, when read with the glasses, give you a clue useful to the case. I'm not too fond of this mechanics because of the number of posts that have to be analyzed, but I appreciated a lot how the development team created for every post a unique conversation between Azami and Jasmine.

Once found, some clues are simply jotted down by Azami and saved in a menu that you can open up at any time to get a recap of the investigation, but others will require you to make a little effort. Sometimes you'll have to complete a mini puzzle where the goal is to fill spaces in a sentence with various terms. This is pretty interesting, even though I found it to be too simple. There are no penalties if you get something wrong, and it's easy to understand the correct phrase due to the grammar and conjunctions. In the case you don't get the sentence right, the game will still highlight the words put in the right place so that you don't have to start from scratch. Neat idea.

I wasn't that much satisfied with the difficulty of the demo. Sure, I didn't certainly expect to solve a complex case at the beginning of the game, but I would have liked more obstacles. The prologue's case and the real, first investigation act as tutorials, so I get that the developers wanted to make them easy. However, I am hopeful that the next cases will be increasingly harder.

Urban Myth Dissolution Center mixes the more classic point-and-click games with visual novels: while investigating, you have to select the people and items that you want to interact with, while the story is told with a dialogue system you've probably seen a lot in Japanese games. What also caught my interest was the art style, as Urban Myth Dissolution Center is a pixel art game with a cool color palette leaning toward blue and light blue colors that highlight elements useful in investigations with a bright red.

I admit it, I was pretty impressed by the Urban Myth Dissolution Center demo. I think it's a detective game with great potential, and my feedback is absolutely positive. I hope that the full game, releasing next February on PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, offers a really compelling story. I would like to help the unfortunate Azami to pay off her debt and make her return to her everyday life, leaving the world of the paranormal behind, if possible.
