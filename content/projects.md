This is a list of all the projects I have worked on (which might be mine or not) in a significant way.

## Personal projects

* [**Rebecca**](https://github.com/AlexzanDev/rebecca) - Rebecca is a really basic CSS "framework" which I created for small websites where I didn't want to use Bootstrap or Tailwind.
* [**Suzu**](https://github.com/AlexzanDev/suzu-scraper) - Suzu is a web scraper that gets updated breaking news from various sources and sends them to a Telegram channel. Written in Python. While the bot is for personal use, the code is open source and you can make yourself a basic news feed.
* [**Shinka**](https://github.com/gamingtalker/shinka) and [**GamingTalker**](https://www.gamingtalker.it/) - GamingTalker is my blog about videogames. I created it using WordPress, and it uses a custom theme, Shinka, based on Underscores by Automattic.
* [**Shijo**](https://github.com/Fumetteria/shijo) - Shijo is a WordPress theme also based on Underscores that I created for a friend's blog.
* [**Mihari**](https://github.com/AlexzanDev/mihari) - This website. It uses Hugo and a modified version of [hugo-theme-flat](https://git.leafee98.com/leafee98/hugo-theme-flat.git).
* There are some other projects I've worked on that are not public yet or that are not completed, like a RSS-to-Telegram bot. Might add them in the future.

## School projects

Since I went to an high school focused on IT, I've created various projects with different languages, such as NodeJS and PHP.

* [**2048 Minecraft**](https://github.com/AlexzanDev/2048-minecraft) - The 2048 game you know, but with Minecraft mobs. Written in vanilla JavaScript.
* [**Various Java programs**](https://github.com/AlexzanDev/java-homework) - Various programs written in Java as homeworks. Don't expect anything complicated or interesting.
* [**Mary**](https://github.com/AlexzanDev/mary) - A simple Blackjack game written in NodeJS with Express and EJS and help from a classmate.
* [**Cafeteria**](https://github.com/AlexzanDev/mensa-php) - While not too complex, me and two classmates created a website for a cafeteria. It uses PHP and MySQL. It doesn't handle payments and customer orders since we wanted to focus on the chef and storekeeper sides of the website.

## Non-code projects

Although it might seem that way, I'm not a fan of coding. I like writing more, so I contributed to some news and guides websites and blogs.

* [**GamingTalker**](https://www.gamingtalker.it/) - As already said, it's a blog about videogames. I write reviews, guides and news everyday.
* [**Manga's Corner**](https://t.me/mangascorner) - A Telegram channel about anime and manga.
* [**Otaku's Journal**](https://www.otakusjournal.it/author/alexzan/) - The first anime and manga related website I wrote for.
* [**linux/hub**](https://linuxhub.it/) - For a while I have been editor-in-chief of linux/hub, a website about Linux guides that still today I like a lot. [Here](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alinuxhubit%2Flinuxhub.it+Alessandro+Zangrandi&type=code) you can find all the articles I wrote: I have to say that I learned lots of things, considering that I was in my first years of high school. I can't thank enough [Mirko Brombin](https://mirko.pm/), the one that gave me this opportunity (and that created two things that Linux users may know: [VanillaOS](https://vanillaos.org/) and [Bottles](https://usebottles.com/)).

## Notes

I plan to do a lot of other stuff in the future, so keep an eye on this page!
